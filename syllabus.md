you can read the [office hour description](misc/office-hour-description.md).

Office Hours:
* Mondays 3 - 3:55 PM
* Wednesday 10 - 11 AM (remote only)
* Friday 9 - 10 AM

I am also happy to schedule additional meetings outside of office hours.

Zoom link for remote office hours:

The best way to contact me about the course is through Piazza.
I also regularly monitor the channel for this course on the unofficial
GVSU Discord,
though I will not post official announcements there and you are not responsible
for monitoring it.

## Course Structure

The course will be run in a primarily "flipped classroom" style.
The majority of course material will be delivered via videos.
During the in-person sections,
* I will give a *brief* review of the lecture material to refresh everyone's
  memory before activities
* students will complete activities, generally in small groups
* students can ask questions about topics in the videos that they would like
  clarified or explained in a different way

The decision to run the course this way is based on feedback from previous
students in my courses regarding their preferred delivery format.
Course feedback has indicated that students felt strongly that watching the
lecture videos aided in their learning and that activities were a better use
of class time.

Although I do not plan to require attendance,
**I reserve the right to make attendance part of the grading scheme and to
require short pre-lecture quizzes later in the semester if participation
in the in-person meetings is lacking.**
(I would notify you via Piazza if I were to make any changes of this sort,
and the changes would not apply retroactively.)

You are very unlikely to succeed in this course if you do not both watch the
lecture videos attentively and come to class and actively participate.

## Course Meetings

For Section 1,
the course meets three times per week for lecture:
* 8 - 8:50 AM Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays (MAK-B-1-118)

Section 1 has lab once per week:
* 1 - 2:50 PM Tuesdays (MAK-A-1-105)

For Section 2,
the course meets two times per week for lecture:
* 4 - 5:15 PM Mondays and Wednesdays (MAK-D-1-117)

Section 2 has lab once per week:
* 3 - 4:50 PM Tuesdays (MAK-A-1-105)

## Sickness Policies

If you are sick,
please do not come to class, lab, or office hours.
Just let me know,
and we will figure out a way for you to make up any missed work.

## Course Objectives

After successful completion of this course, students will be able to:
* Create simple combinatorial and sequential circuits.
* Predict the execution of an instruction in a simple CPU.
* Compare a pipelined CPU design with a single-cycle CPU design.
* Explain the benefits of the memory hierarchy.
* Predict how a cache configuration determines whether a memory
  access is a hit or a miss.
* Produce code in an assembly language using standard programming constructs.

The grading for homework and labs in this course will done somewhat differently
from what you may be used to.
Essentially, you keep working on these until you get the correct answer,
but no partial credit is given.
Instead, I will provide you with helpful feedback about any errors in your
submission and allow you to resubmit without penalty but at a limited rate.
More details about how this works are given below.

This grading scheme is based on the ideas of "mastery grading,"
which you may have seen in various forms in other CS and Math classes.
The benefits to you are that
(1) you have the opportunity to keep trying until you learn the material, and
(2) your grade is likely to be higher than it would be in a standard scheme
if you are willing to put in the work.
The drawback to you is that you cannot coast by a difficult topic on partial
credit --
you need to keep going until you can demonstrate that you understand.

### Homework grading

First, it is important to note that
**all homework scores are either 100% or 0%**.
If you answer five out of six questions correctly,
your score is still 0% until you resubmit and get all questions correct.
Prairielearn may report a homework score as, e.g., 80%,
but that score will be updated to a 0% at the end of the semester if the
homework is not completed.

In homework assignments,
all of the questions will be automatically graded.
You may attempt each problem as many times as needed until you earn full credit
for that problem.

### Lab grading

As with homework,
**all lab scores are either 100% or 0%**.
Prairielearn may report a lab score as, e.g., 80%,
but that score will be updated to a 0% at the end of the semester if the
lab is not completed.

Some of the labs
(primarily the labs that involve assembly coding)
are graded entirely automatically.
For those labs, as with the homework,
you may submit as many times as needed to get full credit.

Labs that are manually graded
(i.e., you submit a lab report and I give you feedback)
will be graded slightly differently.
You complete all questions and submit the lab as a whole when you are ready
for it to be graded by me.
At that point,
I will either score the lab at 100% complete or give you feedback about
mistakes that you made.
If you do not score 100%,
you will be allowed to resubmit as described below.

To submit a lab or request regrading of an updated lab,
simply upload your newest answers to Prairielearn and add an `X` to the
relevant place in the
["grade me" spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1shghdhT2vdgzLtZ1ldm2VO2dvFkBJcX154lu-eaglHk/edit?usp=sharing)
I will check this spreadsheet at the end of every week,
grade as requested,
and clear it for the upcoming week.

A key point to bear in mind is that
**you are limited to two manual lab submissions per week**
(autograded labs do not count toward this total).
This is to avoid waiting until the end of the semester and to ensure that I
can return grades each week in a timely manner.
For example, if you need to redo some questions on Lab X,
you can resubmit Lab X in the same week in which you submit Lab Y.
But, you cannot resubmit Lab X and resubmit Lab Y in the same week in which you
submit Lab Z,
assuming all three are manually graded.
A week starts at 12:00 AM Monday morning and ends at 11:59 PM Sunday night.

Note: You may *not* turn in a partial lab to get feedback on just the part
that you have finished so far.
If any of the questions are skipped, answered with "I don't know,"
or if I determine that any provided answer does not represent a good-faith
effort to solve the problem,
then I will not give feedback on any part of the lab.
Along the same lines,
you may *not* submit a lab unless all automatically-graded parts have
been completed for full credit.

### Project grading

The project grading will be described in detail in the project descriptions
themselves.
Essentially, you continue submitting until you get the completely correct
answer.
However, there are two differences from labs and homework:
1. You can submit projects at most once per day.
2. Projects have a set due date,
   and any submissions after that date will have points deducted.

### Exam grading

The exams will be done in the "standard" way.
However, there is a large number of exams in this course,
so each individual exam is weighted less than you may be used to.

## Important Dates

Deadline to drop with a "W" grade: October 28, 2022, before 5 pm.

Midterm Exam 1: Tuesday, September 20

Midterm Exam 2: TBD

Midterm Exam 3: TBD

Midterm Exam 4: TBD

Final Exam: TBD

## Course Policies

* All gradable work (homework, projects, etc.) must be submitted to
  Prairielearn.
  Some assignments will require drawing diagrams that must be uploaded to
  Prairielearn.
  If you do not have convenient access to a scanner,
  there are free document scanning apps available,
  such as the Google Drive app.
* All projects are due at 11:59 PM EST on the due date.
* Homework assignments are to be completed individually unless directed
  otherwise.
  You may discuss the assignments with other students,
  but every student is expected to submit his or her own work.
  If you find yourself emailing code or written solutions to another student,
  even "for reference", you are violating this policy.
* Labs and projects are to be completed in pairs.
  If you find yourself emailing code or written solutions to another lab group,
  even "for reference", you are violating this policy.
* Exams will not be rescheduled unless in extreme emergencies.
  If you have a question about this, please ask me.
  The exception to this is if an exam falls during a religious observence that
  would not allow you to participate in the exam.
  Rescheduling is perfectly fine in this case,
  but please let me know *as soon as possible* if this will be an issue.
* This course is subject to the GVSU policies listed at
  http://www.gvsu.edu/coursepolicies/.

## Academic Honesty

All students are expected to adhere to the academic honesty standards set forth
by Grand Valley State University.
In addition, students in this course are expected to adhere to the academic
honesty guidelines as set forth by the School of Computing and Information
Systems,
the details of which can be found at
[https://www.gvsu.edu/computing/academic-honesty-30.htm](https://www.gvsu.edu/computing/academic-honesty-30.htm).
Note that for paired or group assignments,
it is expected that every member of the group contributes work toward the final
product,
and **each group member is responsible for the work turned in by the group as a
whole**.

Plagiarism is not tolerated and will result in a grade of 0 for the assignment
in question.
(Code or ideas taken from another source must be cited.)
Violations will be reported to [OSCCR](https://www.gvsu.edu/osccr/)
and handled per university policy.

## Inclusion and Equity

As an instructor,
I will strive to create an equitable and inclusive learning environment in our
class.
To that end,
please reach out to me if there is anything in my behavior or in the classroom
environment that makes you feel unwelcome or unvalued.
I will seek to keep any information you share with me in this regard
confidential to the extent that it is legally possible to do so.

## Special Assistance

If there is any student in this class who has special needs because of
learning, physical or other disability,
please contact me and Disability Support Resources (DSR) at 616.331.2490.
